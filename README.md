# 🚀 KICK_OFF: Design and Implementation of Intelligent Safety Services for Personal Mobility Devices
**AI-powered safety enhancement for personal mobility**  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is an AI-based system designed to improve personal mobility safety through real-time hazard detection and notification, indoor parking return confirmation, and driving habit analysis.
This project integrates **computer vision (YOLOv5, NetVLAD)**, **sensor-based driving habit analysis**, and **web/app interfaces** to create a comprehensive smart mobility solution.  

📖 **Paper Published**:  
[IEEE MetaCom 2023 - Design and Implementation of Intelligent Safety Services for Personal Mobility Devices](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10271873)

## 🔥 Features  
✔ **Real-time hazard detection** (School zones, speed bumps, sudden stops)  
✔ **AI-based pothole & speed bump recognition** (YOLOv5)  
✔ **Visual localization-based parking validation** (NetVLAD) 
✔ **IoT integration with Raspberry Pi for GPS, gyro, and camera uploads**  
✔ **Web-based admin dashboard & mobile app**
